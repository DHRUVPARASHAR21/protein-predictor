**Protein Predictor App
**

Here: https://protein-predictor-mcpxu98vsytzjamjlvxspb.streamlit.app/

This is a web app I built. It predicts and shows the 3D structure of a protein. You just type in a sequence. I created this to be a quick tool. You don't need to install anything.

This project also covers the software engineering process through: 
-local development, 
-version control with Git, 
-code hosting on GitHub, 
-dependency management with requirements.txt, 
-containerized deployment with Streamlit Cloud.

How It Works

You Provide the Sequence: You type or paste a protein sequence into a box. A sequence is a string of letters.

The App Gets to Work: When you click a button, the app takes the sequence. It uses powerful libraries. It figures out the likely 3D shape.

A 3D Model Appears: The app shows an interactive 3D model. You can rotate it. You can zoom in. You can explore the protein's shape.

What I Used to Build It
I used these things to create the app.

Python: This was the main language I used. It's the foundation of the app.

Streamlit: This is a great Python library. It let me build the user interface with Python code. I didn't need to use HTML or CSS.

Git & GitHub: I used these to manage my code. Git tracks every change I make. GitHub stores the project online.

Docker: My app runs in a special container. This is a lot like a Docker container. It means the app is packaged with everything it needs. It will work the same everywhere.

Streamlit Cloud: I used this service to deploy the app. It connects to my GitHub project. It makes the app live on the internet automatically.

The Libraries and My Big "A-ha" Moment
I relied on some special Python libraries.

stmol and py3Dmol: These were the key libraries. They created and displayed the 3D protein model.

biotite: This is a bioinformatics library. It helped me handle the protein sequences.

requests: I used this to get data from other services.

The most important part of this project was learning about the requirements.txt file. When I first deployed the app, it broke. A needed library was missing. I realized Streamlit Cloud's environment didn't have it. I added the library to the file. The app worked perfectly. This taught me a valuable lesson.

How to Run This Yourself
You can run this on your own machine.

Make sure Python is installed.

Clone my repository from GitHub.

Install the libraries. Run pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the app. Type streamlit run your_app_file_name.py in your terminal.
